# Expo Config Plugins: `expo-splash-screen` internal API

Example of using the internal `expo-splash-screen` config plugin API to modify the interface builder file directly as JSON. This would in theory enable users to add things like `UILabel`s to the bottom of the splash screen. 

The API is unexposed since the iOS format is not very user friendly. Developers could potentially refer to my work on [react-xib](https://github.com/EvanBacon/react-xib/blob/main/demo/) to better understand the format.
